            <p>Welcome to Evil Code Quiz. This quiz uses the latest techniques in adversarial instructional design to test your knowledge of JavaScript. Unlike other industry-standard adaptive tests, this test introduces in-the-moment penalties for incorrect answers which negatively impact your ability to answer future questions correctly. This style of testing has been shown to predict educational outcomes with 60% more accuracy than the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) exam.*</p>

            <p>You will start with 60 seconds. For each incorrect answer, ten seconds will be subtracted from your remaining time. Once started, the test must be completed.</p>
